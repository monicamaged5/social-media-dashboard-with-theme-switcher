## My Process

### Built With

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS custom properties (variables)
* Flexbox
* CSS Grid
* JavaScript (theme toggle)



### What I Learned

This project helped reinforce several important frontend concepts:

* Building layouts with **CSS Grid & Flexbox**
* Creating a **theme switcher using CSS variables**
* Handling responsive spacing for different screen sizes
* Implementing UI details like gradient borders and hover states

Example of the theme variable approach:

```css
body.light{
  --bg-body: hsl(0, 100%, 100%);
  --text-primary: hsl(230, 17%, 14%);
}
```



### Continued Development

In future projects, I would like to:

* Improve accessibility and semantic structure
* Refine responsive typography & spacing systems
* Add subtle UI animations and transitions
* Explore component-based architecture


### Useful Resources

* **MDN Web Docs** – Excellent reference for CSS & layout behavior
* **CSS Tricks** – Helped with Grid & Flexbox patterns
* **Frontend Mentor Community** – Inspiration and design references
